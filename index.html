          <p>Jad Saliba was working as a front-line police officer
             in Canada when he was diagnosed with cancer. 
             After receiving treatment, Saliba was re-assigned to a 
             digital forensic unit and quickly learned that the tools 
             police agencies had 
            at their disposal were insufficient to investigate cyber-enabled crimes.

            In short order, police agencies around 
            the world sought out Saliba’s software to modernize 
            their digital investigations. Saliba recognized an opportunity 
            to do more for the pursuit of justice globally if he devoted himself 
            to software development. In 2011, he left policing to launch Magnet
             Forensics with Adam Belsher.
